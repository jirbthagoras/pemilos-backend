/* 
For those who reads this repo, this is one of Mongoose's basics: Schema and Models

*Collection is basically a Table in MongoDB term.

Schema is a definition of Collection. That's it! Just the "definition". Consisting of SchemaTypes

And then comes a Model, which is an implementation of schema in the database. Model is directly
correlated to the Collection.

so:

Schema -> Model -> Collection

// This is the user schema.
const userSchema = new Schema({
     // One of the credentials used by user to vote. A NISN
     username: {
          type: String,
          required: true,
          unique: true
     },

     /* 
     
     Above, lies an SchemaType. Which is a definition of Field, there is so much thing here.\
     Like type (the field's type of course) and some other attribute like unique, lowercase, etc.

     */

     // The real name of user
     name: {
          type: String,
          required: true,

     role: {
          type: String,

          type: String,

     },

     password: {
          type: String,
          required: true,

// Yes, here we exports the user cuz this is the component we'll be using in the logic.
export const User = model("User", userSchema);
